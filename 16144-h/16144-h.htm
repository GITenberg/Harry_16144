<h1>HARRY.</h1>



<h2>PART I.</h2>


<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Love caught his heart in a lovely surprise,</p>
<p>Just the first moment he looked in my eyes:</p>
<p>Poor little eyes! by no prescience lit,</p>
<p>They saw him three weeks ere I lov'd him one bit.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Fair is the book<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> where we read of a life</p>
<p>Born to a throne, taking love for its bliss,</p>
<p>Self-reproach wounding the sweet royal wife</p>
<p>For keeping two years he had asked for as his.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So <i>I</i> might suffer a sort of remorse,</p>
<p>Thinking of days that I cared not, yet knew;</p>
<p>Only, he says, ''Tis a matter of course</p>
<p>Girls should be woo'd and their lovers should woo.'</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Only, the blossom he stoops not to touch.</p>
<p>Sparkling with beauty that lies at his feet;</p>
<p>Only, the blossom he coveteth much,</p>
<p>Is one that shineth as distant as sweet.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Only, a bird may fly helplessly near,</p>
<p>Chirping aloud in a manner too free;</p>
<p>Only, the bird he delighteth to hear,</p>
<p>Sings from the far-away top of a tree.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Is it for this he first fancied me, then?</p>
<p>He to whom earth her allegiance brings,</p>
<p>Noblest of nobles, a king among men,</p>
<p>Hero of heroes! a god among kings!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>'Twill be very nice to be very old,</p>
<p>And with wrinkled brows and eyes that are dim,</p>
<p>To sit by the fire and in dreams behold</p>
<p>The face of the child that was woo'd by him.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Eve in her Eden, belov'd and preferr'd,</p>
<p>Sun, moon, and stars for her benefit made,</p>
<p>Bright as a blossom and gay as a bird,</p>
<p>Earth at her feet like a pleasure-ground laid;</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>All things about her benignant and fair&mdash;</p>
<p>Was she of Adam an actual part?</p>
<p>Love shining over her everywhere&mdash;</p>
<p>Had he no trouble in winning her heart?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Born with a mind even Kant must admit</p>
<p>Had no antecedents for doubt or regret,</p>
<p>Only white paper where nothing is writ,</p>
<p>Was she his wife the first moment they met?</p>
<p>Did she no gradual wooing receive?</p>
<p>Was she never a girl?&mdash;I am sorry for Eve!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Or if like others her history sped,</p>
<p>In those lovely regions to mortals unknown;</p>
<p>Flirting and courting and woo'd ere she wed,</p>
<p>Was the bird of her paradise Eve's chaperone?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I wonder if Adam my fancy would strike</p>
<p>As something like Harry!&mdash;What <i>is</i> Harry like?</p>
<p>Handsome and tall, with command in his eye,</p>
<p>The sweetest of smiles giving sternness the lie;</p>
<p>His soldierly bearing keeps foemen at bay;</p>
<p>His hair is clipped close in the orthodox way;</p>
<p>His nose has a curve from the bridge to the tip:</p>
<p>A statue might envy his short upper lip.</p>
<p>He dances divinely, and walks with an air</p>
<p>Half autocratic and half debonair,</p>
<p>With something about him no words can define:</p>
<p>Eve, was your hero as handsome as mine?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And oh! the years that pass'd over my head</p>
<p>When I was leisurely growing or grown;</p>
<p>And oh! the minutes that suddenly led</p>
<p>To the sweetest thought that ever was known.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Only one glad little glance that I gave,</p>
<p>Where by the window the passion-flower grew,</p>
<p>And a strong man was turn'd into a slave,</p>
<p>Watching and waiting for all that I do.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And a strong man's heart beat only for me&mdash;</p>
<p>Only for me while it answers life's call;</p>
<p>Till <i>I</i> was compell'd to hear and to see;</p>
<p>And only one little look did it all!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, such an infinitesimal thing!</p>
<p>One unthought-of minute hurrying by,</p>
<p>And the whole of two lives yet in their spring</p>
<p>Are utterly chang'd for ever and aye!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>If with idle heart and with careless eyes</p>
<p>I had not happened just there and just then</p>
<p>To smile at a flower beneath the skies,</p>
<p>Should I never have lov'd the first of men?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Had he seen me first in a festal hour,</p>
<p>Or riding, or driving, or by the sea,</p>
<p>And not with a smile for the passion-flower,</p>
<p>Would he never, never have cared for me?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Who planted the root, and its climbing plann'd?</p>
<p>Who water'd below or cherish'd above?</p>
<p>Is it the work of a gardener's hand</p>
<p>That causes my Harry and me to love?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Had that gardener never been born or hir'd,</p>
<p>Or done this one insignificant thing;</p>
<p>Had the passion-flower died;&mdash;my heart is tir'd</p>
<p>With the troublesome sudden thoughts that spring;</p>
<p>And mine eyes are filling with foolish tears,</p>
<p>And the pang that I feel is sharp and keen,</p>
<p>As I see the empty unhappy years,</p>
<p>And I think of all that might <i>not</i> have been.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Treason to love, that such thoughts should arise!</p>
<p>In Heaven I <i>know</i> our marriage was made;</p>
<p>Heaven <i>is</i> somewhere beyond those blue skies,</p>
<p>Why am I weeping and feeling afraid?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Happy the angels, who tenderly plan</p>
<p>These beautiful compacts to glorify man!</p>
<p>Happy the man and the woman who take</p>
<p>Humbly their crown for the dear angels' sake!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Love in our hearts giving strength to endure,</p>
<p>Eternal itself, makes eternity sure;</p>
<p>Earth growing perfect, unspeakably dear,</p>
<p>Only makes heaven seem yet more near.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Why do I tremble in fanciful doubt?</p>
<p>All things&mdash;or nothing&mdash;had brought it about;</p>
<p>Whatever might happen, <i>I must</i> be his;</p>
<p>What signifies <i>talking</i>, since <i>so it is</i>?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So there came the last of the careless days:</p>
<p>Did time in the very same manner move?</p>
<p>(My heart almost stops in a mute amaze</p>
<p>To think that it ever was <i>not</i> in love.)</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Up in the morning, as gay as a lark,</p>
<p>With a glad good-bye to the pleasant night;</p>
<p>Without an idea I am in the dark,</p>
<p>Or that just beyond is the real light;</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Running down stairs, with a laugh as I ran,</p>
<p>Free as 'the blossom that hangs on the bough'&mdash;</p>
<p>I never had given a thought to a man,</p>
<p>And why in the world should I give one now.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Dancing along through the hawthorn-crown'd lane,</p>
<p>'Neath showers of flowers whose name I bear,</p>
<p>Was it not strange I should find Harry Vane</p>
<p>Coming to meet me just then and just there?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Is it for this our two lives have been led,</p>
<p>Each travelling on its different way,</p>
<p>To meet with the blue sky over our head</p>
<p>Shaded by delicate blossoms of may?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Little reck'd I whom I happened to meet,</p>
<p>That I had a lover I never guess'd,</p>
<p>As I danc'd along with my careless feet,</p>
<p>And the heart of a child within my breast.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I had seen him a dozen times before,</p>
<p>With a pleasure that brought no sudden change;</p>
<p>I knew that he lik'd me&mdash;but nothing more:</p>
<p>O Harry! to think of it <i>is</i> so strange!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Sauntering on with the birds and the flowers,</p>
<p>Talking of things that we know or we knew&mdash;</p>
<p>Of the pretty wishes that once were ours</p>
<p>In long-ago times when our years were few:</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>A wild little bird skims rapidly by;</p>
<p>And I tell of a day when my heart was stirr'd,</p>
<p>And I cried as only a child can cry,</p>
<p>That I was a girl instead of a bird.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>'And oh!' in an eager manner I cried,</p>
<p>'I am feeling the very same wish to-day:</p>
<p>Oh for two wild wings, and to spread them wide,</p>
<p>And rush through the sky away and away.'</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I cast up my eyes, to the smiling skies,</p>
<p>And smiling I lower'd their glance again,</p>
<p>And as they were lower'd they met his eyes,</p>
<p>And a thrill went through me of sweetest pain.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I blush'd when I thought of my eager words&mdash;</p>
<p>But why do I blush? and why do I care?</p>
<p>What does it matter to me and the birds,</p>
<p>Or the pretty blossoms or scented air?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>'And I,' he replied, 'have my wishes too:</p>
<p>Time teaches the real meaning of things;</p>
<p>And only this moment, looking at you,</p>
<p>I felt that an angel need <i>not</i> have wings.'</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>We had sauntered on to the garden gate:</p>
<p>He look'd in my eyes ere we turn'd to part:</p>
<p>I walk'd away in a manner sedate,</p>
<p>And with something new just touching my heart.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>When the first violet open'd in bloom,</p>
<p>Was it surpris'd at its lovely perfume?</p>
<p>Why does not History tell us, who met</p>
<p>First, the sweet breath of the first violet?</p>
<p>Rather I'd know it than facts that are known&mdash;</p>
<p>As when some tyrant ascended some throne,</p>
<p>A battle was fought, a comet display'd,</p>
<p>Coals were discover'd, or steam-engines made.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I can no moment recall, ere I knew</p>
<p>Perfume pertain'd to those blossoms of blue;</p>
<p>Had the first knowledge of sweetness like this</p>
<p>Touch'd me to-day, what perfection of bliss!</p>
<p>Children with all that creation can grant</p>
<p>Scarcely will miss the one pleasure I want,</p>
<p>Just to <i>remember</i> the day and the hour</p>
<p>When, by spring breezes caressingly blown,</p>
<p>Delicate fragrance of violet flower</p>
<p>First touch'd my senses, becoming my own!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And what can it be&mdash;oh, what can it be,</p>
<p>That has garnish'd earth with a golden grace?</p>
<p>What is this something that entering me</p>
<p>Changes my life in a minute of space?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>When I first notic'd the power in his eyes&mdash;</p>
<p>Watching to see if they praise or condemn,</p>
<p>Blushing to meet them&mdash;came into the skies</p>
<p>Beauty that never has vanish'd from them.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>When I first stopp'd in the midst of my mirth,</p>
<p>While my heart beat in a tremulous way</p>
<p>Only to see him,&mdash;came over the earth,</p>
<p>Glory that earth has retain'd to this day.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>When the first whisper assaulted my ear,</p>
<p>When the first pressure astonish'd my hand,</p>
<p>When I first fancied that <i>I</i> might be dear&mdash;</p>
<p>Life was a miracle joyous and grand.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>When he first woo'd me with prayers, for his own,</p>
<p>Suddenly came an eclipse of the light:</p>
<p>Sighing, I wish'd he would let me alone;</p>
<p>Smiling, I long'd to hide out of his sight.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Life being lit by a fairy-like gleam,</p>
<p>Sparkling and glittering, tender and pure,</p>
<p>Was not he stupid to change such a dream</p>
<p>Into reality tame and secure?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>'Tis sweet to find I am wrong in the thought,</p>
<p>Joy is but brighter for being confess'd;</p>
<p>Every moment has happiness brought,</p>
<p>Every stage of true love is the best.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>They wish me at home to sit and to sew&mdash;</p>
<p>And I like to do what my aunt thinks right&mdash;</p>
<p>But the stitching never seem'd half so slow,</p>
<p>Nor zigzagg'd itself as it did one night.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And my work kept slipping out of my hand</p>
<p>As wonderful thoughts came into my head:</p>
<p>Sure, life is becoming too bright and grand</p>
<p>To be given up to needles and thread!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I was thinking of words that Harry spake,</p>
<p>And of looks that more than mere words betray,</p>
<p>With a joy as pure as the first snow-flake,</p>
<p>And almost as ready to melt away.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And with little tears beginning to start,</p>
<p>And with smiles and blushes that come and go;</p>
<p>And I did not know what was in my heart,</p>
<p>Or else I pretended I did not know!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>O sudden awaking from dream so fair!</p>
<p>'Tis the voice of my aunt, and I hear it say&mdash;</p>
<p>'Child, are you falling asleep in your chair?</p>
<p>Will you <i>ever</i> finish that collar, May?'</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I caught up my work (I knew I was wrong),</p>
<p>Determin'd to finish it ere we sup;</p>
<p>But something within me, for me too strong,</p>
<p>Conquer'd myself, and I <i>had</i> to give up.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>'O, my Aunt Bridget,' I timidly said,</p>
<p>'I am <i>tired</i> of stitching&mdash;I <i>want</i> to rest;</p>
<p>O let me gather the roses instead,</p>
<p>The young little roses the first and best.'</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Soft summer twilights caressing the air</p>
<p>Have buried the garden in lovely gloom;</p>
<p>But I knew that the eagerest roses there</p>
<p>Were just beginning to think they might bloom.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The pretty wee stars kept peeping about,</p>
<p>And even peep'd in through our prison bars,</p>
<p>As she gravely said, 'Who ever went out</p>
<p>To gather a rose by the light of stars?'</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>My heart beat fast at the beautiful phrase;</p>
<p>She had not intended it, I suppose,</p>
<p>But I felt I could love her all my days,</p>
<p>If under the stars I might pluck one rose!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Pleading my cause in so ardent a way,</p>
<p>Almost evoking an answering glow,</p>
<p>Crying, 'You once were as young and as gay'&mdash;</p>
<p>Then, she smil'd a little and let me go.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>'Twas pleasure enough to be out of doors;</p>
<p>I look'd at the stars and I felt content:</p>
<p>But it never rains, you know, but it pours,</p>
<p>And the path that I <i>had</i> to go&mdash;I went!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Playing with fancies, in fanciful play,</p>
<p>'If I want a rose,' I demurely said,</p>
<p>'I must look for an omen to point the way,</p>
<p>And I must look for it over my head.'</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So I found a star that shone in the sky,</p>
<p>And mark'd how it glitter'd down on a tree,</p>
<p>And felt&mdash;but I swear that I know not why&mdash;</p>
<p>There grow the roses intended for me!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And as I approach the shadowy boughs</p>
<p>That are spreading out over earth and air,</p>
<p>A gay little miracle fate allows,</p>
<p>And the star appears to be sparkling there!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Gladly I ran o'er the daisy-clad plain,</p>
<p>Led by the shimmering light of the star,</p>
<p>And under the tree I found&mdash;Harry Vane</p>
<p>Lying, and smoking a 'mild cigar!'</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I started astonish'd&mdash;he stood upright,</p>
<p>And said, in a voice persuasively kind,</p>
<p>'Don't you <i>know</i> that I come here every night,</p>
<p>To see your shadow flit by on the blind?'</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I look'd where he pointed, as if 'twas I</p>
<p>Could see my own phantom flicker and pass,&mdash;</p>
<p>And <i>Aunt Bridget's</i> shadow mov'd solemnly by,</p>
<p>Over the canvas that hangs by the glass!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, how could we help it?&mdash;we laugh'd aloud</p>
<p>(Birds never cease their sweet voices in spring;</p>
<p>And I think in youth little laughters crowd</p>
<p>And spring to our lips at everything!)</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And when <i>we</i> die (if death ever can be,</p>

<p>He, whom I speak to, smiles into my face,</p>

<p>From the piano I draw forth a peal,</p>

<p>'Twas a beautiful evening, fresh and fair,</p>
<p>Earth sweeter far than impossible skies;</p>
<p>My heart beating light as a bird in air,</p>
<p>When Harry brought home with him Jack Devize.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Did no presentiment touch me that day?</p>
<p>Never a <i>soup&#231;on</i> of evil or ill?</p>
<p>No, the world was bright with Harry away,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The man stood there, and his shadow was laid</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The roses poured out their exquisite scent,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Are there not angels to guard us and keep?</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I have wak'd with the thought of an absent friend</p>

<p>I have run indoors with the happy thought</p>
<p>That something pleasant was going to be,</p>

<p>The sight of the thing it desired to see.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>

<p>I have felt a depression all the day,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And if from the regions of mysteries</p>
<p><i>Something</i> can warn us of trifles like these;</p>
<p>How could it be I met Mr. Devize</p>
<p>With a smiling face and a heart at ease?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>No dream at night, when by wonderful laws</p>

<p>No omen or signal, little or great,</p>
<p>Not a quicken'd pulse or a flutter'd breath;&mdash;</p>
<p>So Harry and I rush'd on to our fate,</p>

<p>We chatted at dinner, and afterwards,</p>
<p>And the moments pleasantly slid away,</p>
<p>But when Mr. Devize suggested cards,</p>
<p>I laughingly told him I could not play.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The cards are produced; the men begin;</p>

<p>Harry is changed&mdash;he is graver,&mdash;I think</p>

<p>He stared in my eyes with a sort of frown,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>He sat at my feet, and his head he laid</p>

<p>The man and the ghost at each other star'd&mdash;</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The man kept on staring with hungry eyes,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>His hand sought his brow in a weak sad way,</p>

<p>'No, Harry,' I whisper'd, 'it is not so;</p>

<p>The ghost caught his hands with a cheer almost,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And so the sorrow was only a dream</p>
<p>(As the sun uprises the dream departs);</p>
<p>And the false false sorrow did only seem,</p>
<p>And the true true joy came into our hearts.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I had so determin'd to be resign'd,</p>

<p>That I felt a little ill-used to find</p>
<p>There was no occasion for being good.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But oh the joy, like the sweetest surprise,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And when earth is deck'd in eternal spring,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I think that the dullest will understand</p>
<p>Jack was not drown'd when he fell from the height;</p>
<p>A ship passing by, as if it was plann'd,</p>
<p>Carried him off mid the darkness of night.</p>
<p>He was up to the neck in debts and scrapes;</p>
<p>And when the west wind refreshingly blew,</p>
<p>He thought it the pleasantest of escapes</p>
<p>To sail for new worlds with nothing to do.</p>
<p>Strolling and idling by day and by night,</p>
<p>He liv'd by his wits, with a laugh for fate;</p>
<p>And his wits not being extremely bright,</p>
<p>He accomplish'd nothing remarkably great.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Wandering ev'rywhere, ragged and poor,</p>
<p>With nothing to do and plenty to say,</p>
<p>By the merest chance he enter'd our door</p>
<p>To ask for a meal and a bed by the way.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So the three of us met delighted there,</p>
<p>And set sail together that perfect spring,</p>
<p>When the skies were fine and the winds were fair,</p>
<p>And our hearts were lighter than anything.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>From the midst of the sea the white cliffs rise&mdash;</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Standing together alone on the deck,</p>
<p>With a hope that almost becomes a fear,</p>

<p>Back to the home whence he vanish'd that night,</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
